# Types of Suspend
#
# The -m switch accepts the following types of suspend:
#  standby – Standby offers little power savings, but restoring to a running system is very quick. This is the default
#            mode if you omit the -m switch.
#  mem     – Suspend to RAM. This offers significant power savings – everything is put into a low-power state, except
#            your RAM. The contents of your memory are preserved.
#  disk    – Suspend to disk. The contents of your memory are written to disk and your computer is powered off. The
#            computer will turn on and its state will be restored when the timer completes.
#  off     – Turn the computer off completely. rtcwake’s man page notes that restoring from “off” isn’t officially
#            supported by the ACPI specification, but this works with many computers anyway.
#  no      – Don’t suspend the computer immediately, just set the wakeup time. For example, you could tell your computer
#            to wake up at 6am. After that, can put it to sleep manually at 11pm or 1am – either way, it will wake up
#            at 6am.
